		      <b>Purpose of Research:</b>
		      This research study is being conducted to
		      collect data on two different types of robot interactions.
		      <br/>
		      <b>What you will do in this study:</b> If you
		      decide to participate, you will first be asked
		      to complete a brief demographic
		      questionnaire, after which you will be presented
		      with a video of a human-robot interaction scenario. You
		      will then be asked to answer
		      questions regarding the scenario. In order to
		      progress through the study and receive your
		      compensation code, you will be required to
		      answer every question unless stated otherwise.
		      <br/>

		      recorded but linked neither to personally
		      identifiable nor worker information. The
		      information will be kept strictly confidential
		      and used only for research purposes. The
		      documentation will be identifiable only by a
		      randomly assigned ID number. All information
		      will be kept on a secure web server.
		      <br/>
		      <b>Participation and Withdrawal:</b> Your
		      participation is completely voluntary. Should
		      you decide at any time you no longer wish to
		      participate you may discontinue your
		      participation without penalty.
		      <br/>

		      questions or concerns about this research please
		      contact the principal investigator: Tom
		      Williams, MIRROR Lab, Colorado School of Mines,
		      1600 Illinois St. Golden, CO, twilliams@mines.edu.
